## Advanced_AEBS_Project

## A fully functional example project of a next generation AEBS braking system that is focused on reducing vehicles reaction time in engaging full force braking

This project is an example that was built when I developed an idea to merge 2 existing braking functions to create the next generation AEBS system that is far more quicker to engage full force braking and also considerably reduce vehicle's reaction distance and braking distance altogether significantly reducing stopping distance to the target object or target vehicle ahead. Every part of this project is a sample that explains how can this functionality to built on Vector CANoe and tested as an entire system
