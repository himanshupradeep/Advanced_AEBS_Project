## Next_Generation_AEBS_Project

## A fully functional example project of a next generation AEBS braking system that is focused on reducing vehicles reaction time in engaging full force braking in emergency sitaution

This project serves as an example showcasing an idea I developed to merge two existing braking functions such as Electronic Brake Prefil, resulting in the next-generation AEBS system. This system is significantly faster in engaging full-force braking, while also drastically reducing the vehicle's reaction distance and braking distance, thereby minimizing the overall stopping distance to the target object or vehicle ahead. Each part of this project provides a sample illustrating how this functionality can be built using Vector CANoe and tested as a complete system.
